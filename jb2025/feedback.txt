Great idea, lots of interesting applications!

If you run into hardware problems, consider simulating the camera. Software driven events can simulate the camera.

Look for a good bank of test images. 

Also consider the potential use cases, when would it be useful for the user to know what mood their face expresses? Practiving for speeches come to mind but there are likely lots more

This should be a fun project, enjoy!
