Interesting idea!

Consider using Internet of Things (IOT) as an application domain. It would be useful to understand the internal classification of IOT, the rate at which each category is growing/shrinking. The categories favored by the fortune 500, what industries? What are the leaning startups? What area of the country/world are they in?

You could think of the project as decision support for venture capital.

Make sure to take advantage of existing web "scraping" tools, this will allow you to focus on your analysis
