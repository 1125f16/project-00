Great project idea!

Make sure you can process the data from the IRIS repository into a friendly format. If you can get JSON or GeoJSON that is usually the best.

Interestingly, there are no projects on Github on this topic. If you enjoy the topic, you can launch an open source project.

Work on "small" formulations to test your assumptions. You can divide your code into modules, start with synthetic data until you get all the pieces working.
