Great idea!

There has been a lot of work done on Yelp reviews. You may want to leverage some of that work.

Not all reviews are equal. You may want to consider review impact, weight, community approval, comments, etc. 

There will also be different metrics of importance for each customer. You could consider a learning algorithm, one that filters reviews based on user preferences.

Consider also reviews on social networks.
