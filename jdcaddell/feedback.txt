Great idea!

It is an ambitious undertaking. Make sure you do a risk analysis early on and pivot if necessary.

Consider simulating components until ready. That way you will have a working system even if a hardware component fails.

If you are struggling with the hardware aspect, keep in mind that there are many off the shelf robot kits available.

This should be a fun project, enjoy!
